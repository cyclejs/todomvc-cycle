TodoMVC in Cycle.js
===================

TodoMVC example implemented in [Cycle.js](http://cycle.js.org).

Updated [branch](https://github.com/cyclejs/todomvc-cycle/tree/onionify) that is based on onionify state management. Hardcore [branch](https://github.com/cyclejs/todomvc-cycle/tree/gh-pages) that neither uses magic [collection package](https://github.com/cyclejs/collection) as in main branch, implementation of which onionify also contains, nor onionify. To run hardcore delete js and -p folders before running start.
